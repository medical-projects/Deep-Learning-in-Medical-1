# Deep-Learning-in-Medical


Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.[


In this Project we need some library to be download 

from keras.layers import Input,Lambda,Dense,Flatten
from keras.models import Model
from keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16
from keras.applications.vgg16 import preprocess_input
from keras.preprocessing import image
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from keras.models import Sequential

after importing thid perticular library you can follow-up my codes if you have any query please let me know in my email -sandeepgamot@gmail.com
